                  <h3 class="section-tag fs-5 mt-3">Doggy Wawky Service</h3>
               <ul  style="list-style-type:none;color:#9d9d9d;">
               <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">2.1 Nature of the Doggy Wawky Service:</span>  The service consists of a desktop Web application, mobile applications, and other related tools, support and services that pet owners <span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold; ">(“Pet Owners”)</span> and providers of pet-related services <span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">(“Service Providers”) </span> can use to find, communicate with and interact with each other. The Doggy Wawky Service includes <span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;"> our emergency support services, educational materials for Service Providers,</span> and other services. We charge fees for some aspects of the Doggy Wawky Service, as described below in Section 9.</li>
                <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">2.2 Doggy Wawky does not provide Pet Care Services </span> Doggy Wawky is a neutral venue for Service Providers and Pet Owners. Doggy Wawky is not a Service Provider and, except for emergency phone support and other resources and support specifically described in the Doggy Wawky Service, does not provide pet care services. We make no representations or warranties about the quality of boarding, pet sitting, dog walking, house sitting, or other services provided by Service Providers <span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;"> (“Pet Care Services”)</span>, or about your interactions and dealings with users. Service Providers listed on Doggy Wawky are not under the direction or control of Doggy Wawky, and Service Providers determine in their own discretion how to provide Pet Care Services. Though we provide general guidance on our Site to Service Providers about safety and pet care and to Pet Owners about selecting and engaging Service Providers, Doggy Wawky does not employ, recommend or endorse Service Providers or Pet Owners, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be responsible or liable for the performance or conduct of Service Providers or Pet Owners, whether online or offline. We conduct an initial review of Service Provider profiles and we facilitate Background Checks or Identification Verifications (each as described in Section 10, below) on Service Providers conducted by a third party, but, except where explicitly specified in the Doggy Wawky Service (and then only to the extent specified), do not otherwise screen Service Providers or Pet Owners. You should exercise caution and use your independent judgment before engaging a Service Provider, providing Pet Care Services, or otherwise interacting with users via the Doggy Wawky Service. Pet Owners and Service Providers are solely responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of themselves and their pets. For example, each user of the Doggy Wawky Service is responsible for keeping current his or her own pet’s vaccinations, and we will have no liability for anyone’s failure to vaccinate his or her pet.</li>

                 <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">2.3 Release:</span>Subject to Section 16 below, Doggy Wawky has no liability for any claims, injuries, loss, harm and/or damages arising from and/or in any way related to your interactions or dealings with other users and the acts and/or omissions of Service Providers and Pet Owners, whether online or offline. You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, YOUR USE AND/OR PROVISION OF PET CARE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK. (Any financial obligations Doggy Wawky may have to its users in connection with user conduct are limited to the reimbursement obligations set forth in the Doggy Wawky Guarantee.)</li>

                  <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">2.4 Transactions are between Pet Owners and Service Providers.</span> The Doggy Wawky Service may be used to find and offer Pet Care Services and to facilitate payment, but all transactions conducted via the Doggy Wawky Service are between Pet Owners and Service Providers. When it comes to refunds of any nature Doggy Wawky will not be held responsible as transaction is done between Pet Owners and Service Providers. When you decide to use Doggy Wawky platform, you agree that Doggy Wawky has no liability for damages associated with Pet Care Services (which may include bodily injury to, or death of, a pet) or resulting from any other transactions between users of the Doggy Wawky Service. When a service provider gets onboard they are charged a one-time fee which is non-refundable. The amount charged will be solely utilized for 3rd party background checks. This fee may be revised depending upon the fluctuation in market conditions. This fee may go up or down depending upon the inflation rate in the market.</li>


                  <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">2.5 Bookings:</span>Pet Owners and Service Providers transact with each other on the Doggy Wawky Service when they both agree to a “booking” that specifies the fees, time period, cancellation policy, and other terms for provision of Pet Care Services via the booking mechanism provided on the Doggy Wawky Service (a “Booking”). A Booking may be initiated by either a Service Provider or a Pet Owner by selecting the type(s) of Pet Care Services to be provided and then following the prompts that appear on-screen. If you are a Pet Owner and you initiate a Booking, you agree to pay for the Pet Care Services described in the Booking when you click “Request & Pay.” If you are a Pet Owner and a Service Provider initiates a Booking, you agree to pay for the Pet Care Services described in the Booking when you click “Pay Now.” All requests are subject to acceptance by the receiving party. The receiving party is not obligated to accept your (or any) request and may, at their discretion, decline for any reason. You acknowledge that, once you complete a Booking, you agree to honor the price and other terms of that Booking, as acknowledged in the Booking confirmation. In case of cancellation from either party for any reason whatsoever, they will need to decide among themselves the best resolution to the problem. Doggy Wawky reserves the right to blacklist any Pet Owner or Pet Care Service Provider depending upon the feedback received.</li>
                  <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">2.6 Pet Owners are Solely Responsible for Evaluating Service Providers.</span> Pet Owners are solely responsible for evaluating the suitability of Service Providers for the services they offer to provide. Though Doggy Wawky performs a limited review of Service Provider profiles and facilitates Service Provider Background Checks or Identity Verifications conducted by a third party, any such screening is limited, and Doggy Wawky does not warrant that any such screen is accurate, complete, conclusive or up-to-date. Similarly, Doggy Wawky does not endorse reviews of Service Providers by other Pet Owners that may be available via the Doggy Wawky Service, and Doggy Wawky makes no commitments that such reviews are accurate or legitimate.</li>
                  <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">2.7 Abandoned Pets; Re-homing.</span> Pet Owners who arrange for Pet Care Services and fail to retrieve their pet after the service period identified in a Booking agree that Doggy Wawky (or the Service Provider) may, in its (or his or her) sole discretion, place the pet in foster care, transfer care to animal control or other law enforcement authorities, or find other alternate care. Pet Owner agrees to reimburse the Service Provider for all costs and expenses associated with such actions. Further, Doggy Wawky expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove a Pet Owner’s pet from a Service Provider’s care should Doggy Wawky deem it necessary for the safety of a pet, the Service Provider, or any persons living with the Service Provider. Should Doggy Wawky not be able to contact the Pet Owner or the primary emergency contact then secondary contact will be utilized to pick up the pet. If you are a Pet Owner, you authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to Doggy Wawky in connection with any such relocation or re-homing of your pet. <span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">In addition, you are responsible for and agree to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Doggy Wawky in connection with such transfer.</span></li>        
                  <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">2.8 Emergencies.</span> We recommend that Pet Owners give their Service Providers contact information where they can be reached in the event medical care for a pet becomes necessary. Service Providers agree to immediately contact Pet Owners in the event such care becomes necessary or, if the Pet Owner is not available, to contact Doggy Wawky at the applicable telephone number or email address listed in the table at the end of these Terms. If you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize your Service Provider and Doggy Wawky to obtain and authorize the provision of veterinary care for your pet if you cannot be reached to authorize care yourself in an emergency situation. In such case, you also authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to Doggy Wawky. If your Service Provider reaches you with a request to authorize medical care for your pet and you refuse, the Service Provider and Doggy Wawky won’t be liable for any injury, damage or liability arising from failure to seek such care. Pet Owners are responsible for the costs of any such medical treatment for pets and, if you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize Doggy Wawky to charge your credit card or other payment method for such costs. Doggy Wawky recommends that all users have adequate pet insurance to cover the costs of veterinary care.</li>
                  <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">
                  2.9 Consultation Services.</span> Doggy Wawky will require vaccination history and medical conditions if any from every Pet Owner at the time of signup to make sure that the Service Provider is also aware of the situation before conducting business with the Pet Owner.</li>
                  <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">
                  2.10 Google Maps.</span> Doggy Wawky Service requires use of Google Maps features and content, which are subject to the current (1) Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service at <a href="#">https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html</a> (including the Acceptable Use Policy at <a href="#">https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/aup/);</a>; and (2) Google Privacy Policy at <a href="privacy.html">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a> (collectively, the "Google Terms"). By using the Doggy Wawky Service, you acknowledge and agree to the Google Terms as they apply to you (e.g., as an "End User"). Any unauthorized use of the Google Maps features and content may result in your suspension or termination from the Doggy Wawky Service.</li>
                  <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">3. Certification of Compliance with Applicable Law.</span>By accessing and using the Doggy Wawky Service, you certify that you: (1) are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher, and (2) will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to your activities conducted through, or related to, the Doggy Wawky Service.</li>

               <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3">For Pet Owners, this means, among other things, that you will ensure that your pets are vaccinated, licensed, identification-tagged and/or microchipped as required by local laws or regulations; that you have obtained and will maintain any mandatory insurance policies concerning the pets whose care you entrust to Service Providers (and that such policies will benefit third parties, including Service Providers, to the same extent they benefit you).</li>
               <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3">For Service Providers, this means, among other things, that you certify that you are legally eligible to provide Pet Care Services in the jurisdiction where you provide Pet Care Services (documented); that you have complied and will comply with all laws and regulations that are applicable to you; that you have obtained all business licenses, business tax registrations, and permits necessary to legally provide Pet Care Services; and that, when providing Pet Care Services, you will comply with applicable leash, pet waste disposal, and similar laws.
               You acknowledge that Doggy Wawky is entitled to rely on these certifications from you, is not responsible to ensure that all users have complied with applicable laws and regulations, and will not be liable for a user’s failure to do so. In case of not providing documentation, Doggy Wawky reserves the right not to allow you to conduct business via our platform.</li>

                        9.1 Currency:</span>  All fees, deductible amounts and other payments referenced on, or charged through, the Doggy Wawky Service are listed and payable in local currency (USD)</li>
                        <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3">
                        <span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">9.2 Fees for Pet Owners:</span> Pet Owners may purchase Pet Care Services from a Service Provider by completing a Booking as described in Section 2.5. If you are a Pet Owner, you enter into a transaction with the Service Provider when you accept a Booking, and you agree to pay the total fees indicated in the Booking. As described in Sections 9.3 and 9.4, the total amount Pet Owners are charged for a Booking may also include a service fee payable to Doggy Wawky. Where required by law, the amount charged will also be inclusive of applicable taxes. The Service Provider, not Doggy Wawky, is responsible for performing the Pet Care Services.</li>
                       <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;"> 9.3 Fees for Service Providers:</span> Service Providers may agree to provide Pet Care Services to a Pet Owner by agreeing to a Booking as described in Section 2.5. If you are a Service Provider, you must confirm the Booking before it expires or the Pet Owner will have no obligation to complete the transaction. Once the Booking is completed by both parties, you agree to honor the price set forth in your Booking. The purchase of Pet Care Services is a transaction between the Pet Owner and the Service Provider. Doggy Wawky’s role is to facilitate the transaction. We will (either directly or indirectly through an authorized third party) collect payment from the Pet Owner at the time of Booking and (except to the extent of any payment hold pursuant to Section 9.7) initiate payment to the Service Provider’s account 48 hours after completion of the service period indicated in the Booking. Service Providers are charged a service fee as described in Section 9.4. Where required by law, the amount charged will also be inclusive of applicable taxes.</li>
                       <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">9.4 Service Fees:</span> We charge service fees for some aspects of the Doggy Wawky Service (5%). If you are a Service Provider, except where otherwise specified via the Doggy Wawky Service, our service fee is calculated as a percentage of the fees a Pet Owner agrees to pay to you in a Booking and is collected from each Booking. In case of multiple booking the 5% will be charged on total sum of the services provided.</li>

In addition, you agree to indemnify Doggy Wawky from, and agree that we may charge your credit card or other payment method for, any additional costs and expenses we or the Service Provider incur as a result of your failure to retrieve your pet at the end of the service period agreed in a Booking.</li>

If you are a Service Provider, you can appoint a substitute Service Provider (as agreed by the Pet Owner and so long as the substitute has an active account on the Doggy Wawky Service and has agreed in writing to accept a Booking) by contacting Doggy Wawky to modify the Booking. If you do not find a substitute and repeatedly cancel accepted Bookings without justification, Doggy Wawky may terminate your account.</li>

For more information about cancellation policies, please check cancellation policy.

In such cases Doggy Wawky may, in its reasonable discretion, issue refunds under terms that vary from a Service Provider’s selected cancellation policy.

                            <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">Refunds for Failure to Perform:</span>If we determine in our reasonable discretion that a Service Provider has failed to provide Pet Care Services as agreed with the Pet Owner or is otherwise in breach of these Terms, then we may, in our reasonable discretion, cancel a Booking and/or issue a full or partial refund to a Pet Owner.</li>
                            <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">General Terms for Cancellations:</span>If you wish to cancel a Booking, you should use the mechanisms available through the Doggy Wawky Service to do so. For purposes of the policies and terms in this Section 9.6, the date of cancellation is the date that a user cancels through the Doggy Wawky Service, regardless of any separate communications between users outside of the Doggy Wawky Service.</li>
                             <li class="paragraph font-monospace text-start mt-3"><span style="color:#020230;font-weight:bold;">Payment Disputes; Payment Outside of the Doggy Wawky Service:</span> Doggy Wawky initiates payments to Service Providers 48 hours after completion of a Booking.
